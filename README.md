Overview
========

Ghost is a [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) mod that enables “ghosting” of players: they become invisible to non-ghost
players and cannot affect the world around them.

Features
========

Current
-------

* Players can be added and removed from the ghost list.
* Ghosts cannot be seen by non-ghost players, but can be seen by other ghosts.
* Ghosts can fly.
* Ghosts cannot modify the world around them (place blocks, harm players, etc.) – or at least, mostly can't. Some
  actions, such as interaction with levers, buttons, etc. still works (but eventually won't – see Planned Features).
